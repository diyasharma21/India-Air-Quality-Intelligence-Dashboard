# India Air Quality Intelligence Dashboard

## Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze air quality patterns across India, focusing on AQI severity, pollutant dominance, geographic distribution, and seasonal trends.

## Objectives
- Analyze state-wise and city-level AQI trends
- Identify high-risk pollution regions
- Understand seasonal AQI variations
- Determine dominant air pollutants

## Key Features
- Dynamic filters for Year, State, and City
- AQI severity gauge with health category
- State-wise AQI geospatial visualization
- Time-series AQI trend analysis
- Pollutant occurrence frequency analysis
- Key insights provided through interactive tooltips

## Key Insights
- North India shows predominantly poor to very poor AQI levels
- PM2.5 is the primary pollutant across major cities
- Winter months record the highest AQI spikes
- Southern regions generally maintain better air quality

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX
- Data Visualization
- Geospatial & Time-Series Analysis
